        "## Introduction\n",
        "In this assignment, we will explore language model inference and training. You will implement various inference algorithms and train a number of simple LMs, ranging from n-gram models to sequence to sequence with attention models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Learning objectives:\n",
        "* Understand how to implement different LM generation algorithms.\n",
        "* Grasp core properties of the different generation algorithms.\n",
        "* Understand how to implement and train various LMs, ranging from n-gram models to sequence to sequence architectures.\n",
        "* Understand the tradeoffs of various modeling decisions when training an LM.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Notes:**\n",
        "* In your solution, keep all code as-is except where it's explicitly mentioned to implement a function.\n",
        "* Items marked with a star (★) should be answered in markdown text in the notebook. You will include your final notebook as a pdf with your submission.\n",
        "* We will automatically save files with results to the results sub-directory, these will be used for autograding. You should submit the results directory with your assignment on gradescope.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Submission:**\n",
        "\n",
        "You will submit:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A PDF copy of your completed notebook. This should be titled \"HW1.pdf\". This is used to grade your answers to the problems marked with a (★).\n",
        "* All the json files saved inside the `results/` directory. These will be autograded.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Setup:**\n",
        "\n",
        "We reccomend running this notebook in Collab, as many of the sections will run much faster on a GPU. You should upload the notebook to Collab and select T4 as the GPU, by selecting \"Runtime -> Change Runtime Type\"."

            "Since 2015, 9,700 petitions, in the interests of protecting the rights of business owners to receive payment for public contracts, were filed by the Office of the Prosecutor General: according to the results of their investigations, 4,500 officials were subject to disciplinary measures, and 533 were held administratively liable; 75 cases were submitted to the investigative authorities for procedural review, and criminal proceedings were initiated in 46 of them.\n",
            "In sum, more than 66 billion rubles worth of debt owed to business owners was repaid.\n",

            "Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt related to state and municipal contracts, identified by the prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, amounted to approximately 27.4 billion rubles.\n",

            "Качественно улучшить платежную дисциплину публичных заказчиков сможет реализация Федерального закона № 189-ФЗ \"О внесении изменений в Кодекс Российской Федерации об административных правонарушениях в части установления административной ответственности должностных лиц заказчика за нарушение срока и порядка оплаты товаров (работ, услуг) при осуществлении закупок для обеспечения государственных и муниципальных нужд\", который на прошлой неделе подписал президент России.\n",
            "С 2015 года в интересах защиты прав предпринимателей на получение оплаты по публичным заказам прокуратурой внесено 9,7 тыс. представлений, по результатам их рассмотрения к дисциплинарной ответственности привлечено 4,5 тыс. должностных лиц, к административной - 533, в следственные органы для организации процессуальных проверок представлено 75 материалов, по 46 из них возбуждены уголовные дела.\n",
            "Ранее Американский союз защиты гражданских свобод (ACLU) объявил предупреждения для путешествующих по Техасу и Аризоне после того, как эти штаты приняли новые законы иммиграционного контроля, согласно которым местным правоохранительным органам предписывалось арестовывать людей за нарушение иммиграционных законов, что, по мнению ACLU, должно было увеличить число проверок по расовому признаку.\n",
            "По словам Национальной ассоциации содействия прогрессу цветного населения, объявить предупреждение по передвижению группу побудил недавно принятый в Миссури закон, из-за которого людям стало труднее выиграть иски, связанные с дискриминацией, а также то, что правоохранительные органы штата непропорционально часто выбирают своими объектами представителей меньшинств.\n",

            "Согласно последним данным программы ФБР по сообщению о преступлениях на почве ненависти, в Миссури за 2015 год было зарегистрировано 100 преступлений на почве ненависти, что делает штат шестнадцатым в государстве по числу подобных нарушений.\n",

Sentences are concatenated together so that one sentence starts right after the other, and an unfinished sentence will be continued in the next batch.

To properly deal with this input format, you should save the last state of the LSTM from a batch to feed in as the first state of the next batch.  When you save state across different batches, you should call `.detach()` on the state tensors before the next batch to tell PyTorch not to backpropagate gradients through the state into the batch you have already finished (which will cause a runtime error).\n",

I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\\'t have much of a plot.', 'label': 0}\n"

Additionally, we see that in some cases, the mapping is off-diagonal. This means that the German word order differs from the English word order and our model is able to learn this re-ordering. Some of the attention weights are also split across multiple words which may indicate that the model has learned mappings from multiple words in German to single words in English."

        "For extra credit, let's implement beam search.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similar to greedy search, beam search generates one token at a time. However, rather than keeping only the single best hypothesis, we instead keep the top $k$ candidates at each time step. This is accomplished by computing the set of next-token extensions for each item on the beam and finding the top $k$ across all candidates according to total log-probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Candidates that are finished should stay on the beam through the end of inference. The search process concludes once all $k$ items on the beam are complete.\n",
        "\n",
        "With beam search, you should get an improvement of at least 0.5 BLEU over greedy search, and should reach above 21 BLEU without attention and above 37 BLEU with attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tips:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1) A good general strategy when doing complex code like this is to carefully annotate each line with a comment saying what each dimension represents.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) You should only need one call to topk per step. You do not need to have a topk just over vocabulary first, you can directly go from vocab_size*beam_size to beam_size items.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Be sure you are correctly keeping track of which beam item a candidate is selected from and updating the beam states, such as LSTM hidden state, accordingly. A single state from the previous time step may need to be used for multiple new beam items or not at all. This includes all state associated with a beam, including all past tokens output by the beam and any extra tensors such as ones remembering when a beam is finished.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Pay attention to how you interleave things when using a single dimension to represent multiple things.  It will make a difference when you start reshaping to separate them out.  It may be easier to start with everything separate, then temporarily combine as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) For efficiency, we suggest that you implement all beam manipulations using batched PyTorch computations rather than Python for-loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) Once an EOS token has been generated, force the output for that candidate to be padding tokens in all subsequent time steps by adding a large positive number like 1e9 to the appropriate logits. This will ensure that the candidate stays on the beam, as its probability will be very close to 1 and its score will effectively remain the same as when it was first completed.  All other (invalid) token continuations will have extremely low log probability and will not make it onto the beam.\n",
