        "## Introduction\n",
        "In this assignment, we will explore language model inference and training. You will implement various inference algorithms and train a number of simple LMs, ranging from n-gram models to sequence to sequence with attention models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Learning objectives:\n",
        "* Understand how to implement different LM generation algorithms.\n",
        "* Grasp core properties of the different generation algorithms.\n",
        "* Understand how to implement and train various LMs, ranging from n-gram models to sequence to sequence architectures.\n",
        "* Understand the tradeoffs of various modeling decisions when training an LM.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Notes:**\n",
        "* In your solution, keep all code as-is except where it's explicitly mentioned to implement a function.\n",
        "* Items marked with a star (★) should be answered in markdown text in the notebook. You will include your final notebook as a pdf with your submission.\n",
        "* We will automatically save files with results to the results sub-directory, these will be used for autograding. You should submit the results directory with your assignment on gradescope.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Submission:**\n",
        "\n",
        "You will submit:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A PDF copy of your completed notebook. This should be titled \"HW1.pdf\". This is used to grade your answers to the problems marked with a (★).\n",
        "* All the json files saved inside the `results/` directory. These will be autograded.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Setup:**\n",
        "\n",
        "We reccomend running this notebook in Collab, as many of the sections will run much faster on a GPU. You should upload the notebook to Collab and select T4 as the GPU, by selecting \"Runtime -> Change Runtime Type\"."

To properly deal with this input format, you should save the last state of the LSTM from a batch to feed in as the first state of the next batch.

I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\\'t have much of a plot.', 'label': 0}\n"

        "\n",
        "Similar to greedy search, beam search generates one token at a time. However, rather than keeping only the single best hypothesis, we instead keep the top $k$ candidates at each time step. This is accomplished by computing the set of next-token extensions for each item on the beam and finding the top $k$ across all candidates according to total log-probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Candidates that are finished should stay on the beam through the end of inference. The search process concludes once all $k$ items on the beam are complete.\n",

        "With beam search, you should get an improvement of at least 0.5 BLEU over greedy search, and should reach above 21 BLEU without attention and above 37 BLEU with attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tips:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1) A good general strategy when doing complex code like this is to carefully annotate each line with a comment saying what each dimension represents.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) You should only need one call to topk per step. You do not need to have a topk just over vocabulary first, you can directly go from vocab_size*beam_size to beam_size items.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Be sure you are correctly keeping track of which beam item a candidate is selected from and updating the beam states, such as LSTM hidden state, accordingly. A single state from the previous time step may need to be used for multiple new beam items or not at all. This includes all state associated with a beam, including all past tokens output by the beam and any extra tensors such as ones remembering when a beam is finished.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Pay attention to how you interleave things when using a single dimension to represent multiple things.  It will make a difference when you start reshaping to separate them out.  It may be easier to start with everything separate, then temporarily combine as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) For efficiency, we suggest that you implement all beam manipulations using batched PyTorch computations rather than Python for-loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) Once an EOS token has been generated, force the output for that candidate to be padding tokens in all subsequent time steps by adding a large positive number like 1e9 to the appropriate logits. This will ensure that the candidate stays on the beam, as its probability will be very close to 1 and its score will effectively remain the same as when it was first completed.  All other (invalid) token continuations will have extremely low log probability and will not make it onto the beam.\n",
        "\n",
        "7) While you are encouraged to keep your tensor dimensions constant for simplicity (aside from the sequence length), some special care will need to be taken on the first iteration to ensure that your beam doesn't fill up with k identical copies of the same candidate.\n"
